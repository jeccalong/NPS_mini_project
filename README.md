# NPS Mortality Data Analysis

This project explores deaths reported in U.S. National Park Service (NPS) units and compares them with visitation to understand whether higher death counts correlate with visitation, or whether certain parks are outliers and seemingly more dangerous.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python packages:  
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open `NPS_mini_project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.


## Example Output
The analysis shows that drowning is the most frequent cause of death and several NPS units have many more deaths compared to other parks. Lake Mead specificly is an outlier with more than double the deaths than the next highest, Cape Hatteras.
